**Learning:** Thread-blocking alerts for simple UI feedback disrupt the user experience and are inaccessible. Using temporary inline text changes with `aria-live="polite"` provides a seamless and accessible state change for screen readers.
**Action:** Always avoid `alert()` for simple interactive feedback like copy buttons, and opt for inline state changes with ARIA support.

**Action:** When replacing `disabled` with `aria-disabled='true'`, always ensure click events are blocked using `if(this.getAttribute('aria-disabled') === 'true') return;` or equivalent guard logic to prevent functional regressions.
