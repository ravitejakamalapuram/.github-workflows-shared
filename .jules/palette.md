## 2026-06-07 - Replaced blocking alert with accessible inline feedback
**Learning:** Thread-blocking alerts for simple UI feedback disrupt the user experience and are inaccessible. Using temporary inline text changes with `aria-live="polite"` provides a seamless and accessible state change for screen readers.
**Action:** Always avoid `alert()` for simple interactive feedback like copy buttons, and opt for inline state changes with ARIA support.

## 2026-06-07 - Implement aria-disabled for disabled button tooltips
**Learning:** Replacing native `disabled` with `aria-disabled="true"` to allow tooltips for screen readers and hovers natively exposes elements to click events. Thus, you must implement javascript event guards on the handler directly.
**Action:** When replacing `disabled` with `aria-disabled='true'`, always ensure click events are blocked using `if(this.getAttribute('aria-disabled') === 'true') return;` or equivalent guard logic to prevent functional regressions.

## 2026-06-07 - Replace blocking alerts with accessible toast notifications
**Learning:** Thread-blocking alerts for simple UI feedback disrupt the user experience and are inaccessible. Using temporary inline text changes with `aria-live="polite"` provides a seamless and accessible state change for screen readers.
**Action:** Always avoid `alert()` for simple interactive feedback, and opt for inline state changes with ARIA support.
## 2025-02-14 - Instant Form Validation & Accessible Disabled States
**Learning:** Native disabled properties prevent pointer events, breaking tooltip hovers and screen reader focus. Furthermore, failing to bind to `oninput` delays visual feedback for users.
**Action:** Always migrate to `aria-disabled="true"` with custom event guards (and contextual state recovery for async actions) while ensuring form elements immediately reflect validation via `oninput`.
