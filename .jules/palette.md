## 2026-06-07 - Replaced blocking alert with accessible inline feedback
**Learning:** Thread-blocking alerts for simple UI feedback disrupt the user experience and are inaccessible. Using temporary inline text changes with `aria-live="polite"` provides a seamless and accessible state change for screen readers.
**Action:** Always avoid `alert()` for simple interactive feedback like copy buttons, and opt for inline state changes with ARIA support.

## 2026-06-07 - Implement aria-disabled for disabled button tooltips
**Learning:** Replacing native `disabled` with `aria-disabled="true"` to allow tooltips for screen readers and hovers natively exposes elements to click events. Thus, you must implement javascript event guards on the handler directly.
**Action:** When replacing `disabled` with `aria-disabled='true'`, always ensure click events are blocked using `if(this.getAttribute('aria-disabled') === 'true') return;` or equivalent guard logic to prevent functional regressions.

## 2026-06-07 - Replace blocking alerts with accessible toast notifications
**Learning:** Thread-blocking alerts for simple UI feedback disrupt the user experience and are inaccessible. Using temporary inline text changes with `aria-live="polite"` provides a seamless and accessible state change for screen readers.
**Action:** Always avoid `alert()` for simple interactive feedback, and opt for inline state changes with ARIA support.

## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Add aria-live to copy buttons
**Learning:** For inline text changes that provide user feedback (e.g., changing "Copy" to "Copied!"), adding `aria-live="polite"` dynamically ensures screen readers announce the state change without requiring a thread-blocking alert or complex role management.
**Action:** Always verify if interactive elements that mutate their text dynamically to indicate success/error have appropriate aria-live regions so visually impaired users receive the same confirmation as sighted users.
